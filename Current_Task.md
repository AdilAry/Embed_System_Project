### Marco Polo game;

The board sends two messages periodically, one of the is "Marco", the other is something different
The runner has to verify that it's "Marco" in which case it responds "Polo" or "Wrong" if that was any other message.

### Communication doc;
It should have all the information related to the PC and Board communicating with each other.
Like what protocol are we using, what registers are we using and etc.

You also have to have a way to visualize your information, like with Graphana for example.
And then there needs to be a way to log/store all of your information, maybe like in a database let's say.

On graphana, teacher has a github repo with graphana and modbus stuff:

### Presentation stuff;
Add a segment on Power efficiency.

Once the deliverables arrive, test it and take it's photos.

Maybe make and add a Block Diagram of the system.

Add animations, like text appearing gradually, important for pages that have a lot of stuff in them, to not visually frontload basically
