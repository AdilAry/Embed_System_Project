Presentation Material contains all the material that was displayed and are related to the code review session.
Which includes the C code for the actual BMS, the communication documentation the information from which was used in making the C code, and a another piece of C code written by myself last year that was used as a template basis for the project code.

Support Material directory is dedicated to all the material that is related mostly to the CI/CD pipeline(alongisde the BMS simulator code that I used when at home, however I didn't manage to find the serial version of it so there is not working BLE version of it).
The material in here is the BMS simulator code for my ESP32, Python code to get the information to the Prometheus database, Robot file that tests the results and the Gitlab yaml that points towards it.

Unsorted Material refers to the directory the contents of which are just unsorted. Which probably was a result messy work between home and uni.
