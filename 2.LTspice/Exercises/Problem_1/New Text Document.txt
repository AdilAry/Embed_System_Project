The circuit uses an op amp configured as an error amplifier in a linear voltage regulator topology, with an NPN pass transistor (e.g., a high-voltage type like 2N3055 or TIP35C) to handle the output. The op amp and pass transistor are powered from the 40V supply. A voltage divider provides feedback to scale the output voltage down for comparison against a variable low-voltage reference (Vref) provided by the microcontroller's DAC output (assuming a 0-5V DAC range; adjust scaling if different). This allows Vout to be adjusted from 25V to 35V by varying Vref from 2.5V to 3.5V.

### Key Components:
- Op amp: High-voltage type capable of 40V rail (e.g., OPA445 or LM358 with appropriate ratings).
- Pass transistor: NPN BJT rated for >40V and low current (e.g., 100mA max for biasing applications).
- Resistors for feedback divider: R1 = 1kΩ (from feedback node to GND), R2 = 9kΩ (from Vout to feedback node). This sets Vfb = Vout / 10.
- Optional: Small capacitor (e.g., 10nF) across R2 for stability; current-limiting resistor (e.g., 1kΩ) in series with op amp output to base if needed for protection.

### Circuit Description:
1. Connect the 40V supply to the collector of the NPN transistor and the positive rail of the op amp.
2. The emitter of the NPN transistor is the output (Vout).
3. Connect the op amp's non-inverting input (+) to the microcontroller's DAC output (Vref, 2.5V to 3.5V).
4. Connect the op amp's inverting input (-) to the feedback node (Vfb).
5. The feedback divider: Vout → R2 → feedback node → R1 → GND.
6. Connect the op amp output directly to the base of the NPN transistor (or via a small resistor for current limiting).
7. Ground the op amp's negative rail.

### Operation:
- The op amp drives the NPN base to make Vfb = Vref.
- Thus, Vout = Vref × (R1 + R2) / R1 = Vref × 10.
- Varying Vref from 2.5V to 3.5V gives Vout from 25V to 35V.
- For low-power biasing (<10mA), no heatsinking is needed; efficiency is ~ (Vout / 40V) since it's linear.

If the microcontroller lacks a DAC, use PWM output filtered through an RC low-pass filter (e.g., 10kΩ resistor and 1µF capacitor) to generate the analog Vref. Ensure the op amp and transistor are rated for the voltages and add protection diodes if necessary for real-world use.
